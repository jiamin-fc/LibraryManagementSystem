# Library Management System

This project is a simple Library Management System developed using Java, Spring Boot, ReactJS, and MySQL. It offers comprehensive capabilities for managing a library, including read, write, edit, and delete operations for both frontend, backend, and the connected database.

## Features

### Frontend
The frontend of this system is built using ReactJS. It provides an intuitive user interface for managing library resources.

### Backend
The backend is implemented in Java with Spring Boot. It serves as the core logic for handling various operations and interacts with the database.

### Database
MySQL is used as the database system for storing and managing library-related data. It stores information about books, authors, users, and other relevant entities.

## Functionalities

- **Read:** Users can access and view information about available books, authors, and other library resources.
- **Write:** Authorized users can add new books, authors, and other related data into the system.
- **Edit:** Update and modify existing book details, author information, and other relevant data as needed.
- **Delete:** Remove outdated or unnecessary records from the library database.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK
- Node.js 
- MySQL Database

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the backend by navigating to the backend directory and running necessary commands (e.g., `mvn install`, `mvn spring-boot:run`).
3. Set up the frontend by going into the frontend directory and installing dependencies (`npm install`) followed by running the application (`npm start`).
4. Configure the MySQL database connection in the backend configuration files.
